# The Book

You can access the book [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/AshifulBhuiyan/my-math-problems/blob/main/book.pdf).

# Advanced Mathematics Collection

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of mathematics topics divided into multiple chapters, including:

- Algebra
- Calculus
- Differential Equations
- Optimization
- Real Analysis
- Complex Analysis
- Linear Algebra
- Abstract Algebra
- Functional Analysis
- Topology
- Probability
- Statistics
- Combinatorics
- Measure Theory
- Set Theory
- Number Theory

The main document (`book.tex`) compiles all the chapters into a single book format, which can be compiled using LaTeX to generate a PDF version of the complete collection.

## Getting Started
To compile the LaTeX document:
1. Make sure you have a LaTeX distribution installed (e.g., TeX Live, MiKTeX).
2. Navigate to the folder containing the main `book.tex` file.
3. Run the LaTeX compilation command (e.g., `pdflatex book.tex`) in your terminal or command prompt.

## Contributing
If you would like to contribute to this collection, feel free to add solutions to the problems, or improve existing solutions.

## License
I just do math, I don't understand this Licensing stuff? Do what ever you want with these problems, they're not even my original problems and compiled from various various texts and authors and professors, peers, students and mentors. I just put them all together in one place.
